MACHINE LEARNING TUTORIAL:

This is the repository of machine learning, where the supervised learning algorithms are learned by me.
The following algorithms are practiced in this repository.
1. Linear Regression: Linear Regression is the most basic supervised learning algorithm. It predicts the value of the target variable by creating a line and then using linear regression model to best fit the line.
2. Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is the basic classification algorithm where we predict the output in the form of "Yes" or "No". In Logistic Regression we divide the Yes and No probabilities by a line and then use the model to best fit that line.
3. Decision Tree and Random Forest: Decision Tree and Random Forest are also classification algorithms. In Decision Tree we create a tree of features and then give the output based on it whereas Random Forest algorithm is the collection of Decision Trees where we combine different Decision Trees and create a Random Forest. Random Forest is a great algorithm which can improve the accuracy of Decision Tree model by a huge amount.
